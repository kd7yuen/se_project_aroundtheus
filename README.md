# Project 5: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

Created a webpage with cards that follow a grid pattern and can adjust to different screen types.

This now includes the early works of interactive javascript. The edit button now displays a popup to edit the profile. Added a sticky footer that always stays at bottom even when more cards added.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
